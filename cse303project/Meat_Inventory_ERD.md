- **Status**: Ready for implementation phase (Analysis and Design Complete)

### **Project Scope & Requirements**
This comprehensive meat inventory management system addresses **7 core requirements**:

1. **Detailed Product Data Management**: Complete tracking of meat products with nutritional info, certifications, and packaging details
2. **Livestock and Processing Monitoring**: End-to-end tracking from livestock suppliers through processing batches
3. **Multi-Facility Stock Tracking**: Inventory management across multiple storage facilities and zones
4. **FIFO/FEFO Implementation**: Automated inventory rotation based on production dates and expiry dates
5. **IoT Sensor Integration**: Real-time environmental monitoring with sensor data and alerts
6. **Yield Analysis and Waste Tracking**: Processing efficiency analysis and comprehensive waste management
7. **Regulatory Compliance and Food Safety**: Complete traceability, quality inspections, and compliance records

### **Advanced Database Design Features**
- **25+ Entities** with complex attribute structures
- **5 Superclass/Subclass Relationships** with proper discriminator attributes
- **4 Weak Entities** with composite primary keys
- **1 Associative Entity** for many-to-many relationships
- **60+ Comprehensive Business Rules** covering all domain logic
- **Advanced Attributes**: 15+ composite, 15+ multivalued, 15+ composite-multivalued attributes

### **Business Impact**
- **Minimize spoilage and waste** through automated rotation management
- **Ensure food safety** through complete traceability and quality control
- **Regulatory compliance** for halal certification, export requirements, and government standards
- **Operational efficiency** through IoT monitoring and yield analysis
- **Supply chain transparency** from livestock suppliers to end consumers

### **Implementation Readiness**
- ✅ **Requirements Analysis**: Complete with 7 core requirements
- ✅ **ERD Design**: Enhanced with all advanced database concepts
- ✅ **Business Rules**: 60+ comprehensive rules documented
- ✅ **Discriminator Attributes**: All 5 superclass/subclass relationships properly defined
- ✅ **Weak Entity Specifications**: All 4 weak entities with composite primary keys
- ✅ **Visual Diagrams**: Complete Mermaid ERD generated and verified
- 🔄 **Next Phase**: Physical database implementation and normalization
