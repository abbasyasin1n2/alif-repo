# CSE303 Project Documentation - Inventory Management for Meat-based Products in Bangladesh

## Project Overview

**Topic**: Inventory Management for Meat-based Products in Bangladesh
**Focus**: Track meat products from processing to distribution, minimizing spoilage and waste.

## Project Requirements (7 Core Requirements)

1. **Detailed data on meat products**, including animal type (e.g., beef, poultry, pork), cut type, processing date, storage requirements, shelf life, packaging details, and supplier information.

2. **Monitoring of incoming livestock or meat cuts**, including quantities, processing dates, and movement across processing units, ensuring traceability and quality control.

3. **Continuous tracking of stock levels** across multiple storage facilities, enabling timely restocking and reducing the risk of stockouts or overstocking.

4. **Tracking of product expiration dates and batch numbers** to facilitate First-In, First-Out (FIFO) or First-Expired, First-Out (FEFO) inventory rotation, minimizing spoilage and waste.

5. **Integration with sensors** to monitor storage conditions such as temperature and humidity, ensuring optimal environments for preserving meat quality.

6. **Recording and analyzing data on meat yields** from processing activities, including tracking of trimmings, bones, and offal, to assess processing efficiency and identify areas for waste reduction.

7. **Maintaining detailed records** to comply with food safety regulations, including the ability to quickly trace and recall specific batches in the event of a food safety issue, ensuring consumer safety and regulatory adherence.

## Project Report

### Problem Statement

The current meat processing and distribution system in Bangladesh faces significant challenges in tracking products from processing to distribution, resulting in substantial spoilage and waste. The existing manual processes lack real-time visibility, proper traceability, and automated inventory management, leading to food safety risks, regulatory compliance issues, and economic losses. There is an urgent need for a comprehensive digital inventory management system that can monitor meat products throughout the supply chain, ensure quality preservation through environmental controls, and provide complete traceability from livestock suppliers to end consumers while minimizing waste and maintaining food safety standards.

### Existing System (Rich Picture As-Is) Explanation

The current system operates entirely on manual processes with significant inefficiencies. Livestock suppliers deliver animals through verbal agreements with basic paper documentation. The processing plant manager manually oversees operations using inconsistent paper records and unreliable temperature gauges for monitoring. Warehouse managers conduct time-consuming manual stock counts using basic spreadsheets and rely on phone calls for stock updates. Transportation personnel move products with paper receipts without any batch tracking capabilities. Government inspectors perform limited manual spot checks with restricted access to records. The system operator manually enters data into disconnected spreadsheets, making the process error-prone and time-consuming. This manual approach results in critical problems including spoilage and waste due to poor temperature monitoring, complete lack of product traceability, food safety risks from inadequate record-keeping, and inefficient communication channels that further contribute to waste and operational inefficiencies.

### Methodology

The proposed digital transformation follows a comprehensive systems integration approach, implementing seven core requirements for effective meat inventory management:

1. **Detailed Product Data Management** - Capturing animal type, cut type, processing dates, storage requirements, shelf life, and packaging details
2. **Livestock Monitoring** - Real-time tracking of quantities, processing dates, and movement across facilities
3. **Multi-Facility Stock Tracking** - Continuous monitoring of inventory levels with automated restocking alerts
4. **FIFO/FEFO Implementation** - Automated rotation systems based on expiration dates and batch numbers
5. **Environmental Monitoring** - IoT sensors for temperature and humidity control
6. **Yield Analysis** - Comprehensive tracking of processing efficiency and waste reduction
7. **Regulatory Compliance** - Complete digital audit trails with quick recall capabilities

### Proposed System (Rich Picture To-Be) Explanation

The proposed digital inventory management system transforms the entire supply chain through integrated technology solutions. Livestock suppliers now provide digital delivery records with QR codes and timestamps directly to the digitally-enabled processing plant. The central digital inventory system serves as the core hub, connecting all stakeholders and managing seven specialized modules: Product Data, Livestock Monitoring, Multi-Facility Stock Tracking, FIFO/FEFO System, IoT Sensors, Yield Analysis, and Compliance System. The warehouse operates with smart monitoring capabilities, providing real-time stock levels and environmental data. Transportation personnel utilize real-time tracking systems with product scanning and route optimization. Retail shop owners receive comprehensive digital traceability information including batch details and expiry alerts. End consumers gain access to complete quality history and product transparency through the quality history system. The government inspector benefits from automated regulatory reporting and real-time compliance monitoring. All systems are maintained by the system operator through the central digital platform, ensuring seamless integration and automated processes that eliminate manual errors, reduce waste, ensure food safety, and provide complete traceability throughout the meat product supply chain in Bangladesh.

### Current Project Status

- **Phase**: Requirements and design completed
- **Rich Pictures**: Both As-Is and To-Be verified and aligned
- **Gap Analysis**: Complete with all 8 stakeholders
- **Flask Framework**: Ready for meat inventory implementation
- **Database**: MySQL connected and operational
- **Next Steps**: Implementation of meat inventory management system

### Important Notes for Future Sessions

1. **User "abbas"** is the test user account (password: abbas123)
2. **Database connection verified** - MySQL on localhost:3306
3. **All 7 requirements covered** in the rich pictures and gap analysis
4. **Framework is complete** - ready to build meat inventory features
5. **Documentation purpose**: Prevent loss of context across sessions

---

**Last Updated**: Current session - All rich pictures, gap analysis, project report, and technical framework details completed and verified.
**Documentation Created**: For easy reference and continuation of work without losing chat history context.
